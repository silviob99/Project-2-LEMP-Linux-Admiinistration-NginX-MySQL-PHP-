In order to complete this project we will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS. 

If you do not have an AWS account - go to [**Project 1 Step0**](https://github.com/silviob99/Project-1-Web-Stack-Implementation-LAMP/blob/main/STEP0-Prerequisites.md) to sign in 
to AWS free tier account and create a new EC2 instance of t2.nano family with Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM) image. Remember, you can have multiple EC2 instances, but make sure you **STOP** the ones you are not working with at the moment to save available hours. 

**Hint**: In previous project I have used Putty on Windows to connect to my EC2 instance, but there is a simpler way that do not require conversion of **.pem** key to **.ppk** -using [**Git Bash**](https://gitforwindows.org/).
